I started this project in order to learn more about cryptocurrencies, particularly the underlying technology behind them: blockchains

Initial work is following the tutorial found here: 
https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248b

I have a couple things I would like to implement once I am done working through this example such as adding the ability to create a wallet and a ledger UI similar to the one at [blockexplorer.com](https://blockexplorer.com/)
